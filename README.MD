# CMD Fix 
CMD-Fix will make windows usable again, it removes the cancer shell context menu and addes the cmd context menu that you actually want.

Open the registry editor and take ownership of `Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\` and give yourself write access.

Then just run the program.

Options parameter `--no-extend` can be used to remove the need to press `CTRL` when right-clicking to get it in the context menu.
